基于STM32F103C8T6单片机与WBS3WIFI模组的智能温湿度传感器，通过涂鸦云实现温湿度数据的远程收集,APP实时查看数据，加热器和排风扇根据DHT11温湿度计的数据作出相应动作，加热器和排风扇也可通过涂鸦云进行远程控制，涂鸦云也可以根据设定的温湿度、温度阈值，远程对单片机发送指令自动操控加热器与排风扇。
STM32F103C8T6 based on single chip microcomputer and WBS3WIFI module of the intelligent temperature and humidity, temperature and humidity are implemented by graffiti cloud data of the remote collection, APP to view real-time data, heater and fan according to the data to make the corresponding action DHT11 temperature and humidity meter, heater and fan can also remote control by graffiti cloud, graffiti cloud can also according to the setting of the temperature and humidity, temperature threshold, the distance of single chip microcomputer automatic manipulation of the heater and fan send instructions.
